alembic for migrations

Need to set DATABASE_URL in .env

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create economy tables"
alembic upgrade head
```

When creating a SQLAlchemy model, needs to be imported in alembic/env.py
Also needs to be added to the cog_loader

Put suggestions for new commands/features
- Affirmations
- Roasts
- Add hunting/other economy features
- Practice question generator (command would take course code as an argument)

Add instructions for creating commands that utilize 3rd party libs (link page to get API key, etc)

Privileged intents (add to docs)

only free third party libs allowed, if implementing something that requires an additional API key specify this in the pull request with a link showing where to get it

go through all boilerplate needed to setup a command/cog
