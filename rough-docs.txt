alembic for migrations

Need to set DATABASE_URL in .env

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create economy tables"
alembic upgrade head
```

When creating a SQLAlchemy model, needs to be imported in alembic/env.py
Also needs to be added to the cog_loader

Put suggestions for new commands/features
- Affirmations
- Roasts
- Add hunting/other economy features
- Practice question generator (command would take course code as an argument)

Add instructions for creating commands that utilize 3rd party libs (link page to get API key, etc)
